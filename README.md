# CSS Selectors game

It's a fun game to learn and practice CSS selectors. The simulator consists of several game levels. Each level includes a layout example and html code that corresponds to the current level. Some layout elements are highlighted using animation. The user's task is to write a CSS selector that matches all selected layout elements.
